An endulgment of my nostalgia for early internet. Dossip was made in Unreal 4.27, and a large effort was made to reduce the graphics of the engine as much as possible so it appears to play on 90s DOS based PCs (hence the name). I’m very proud of its successes for such a small game.</p> <p>Some fun facts, The usernames were created by mashing together two databases. One that consisted of random online usernames scraped from various websites and another of just weird/funny words grabbed from listicals.</p> <p>The large amount of chat text was crowdsourced by myself and my friends, the goal was to try and be bizzare.</p> <p>A friend and my twin brother both contributed sprites to the project. The character meshes and textures are from opengameart.org and some shader features like the affine mapping that you see on the characters were created by DaveFace.</p> <p>“No WiFi, no problem! Have online fun, offline!”</p> <p>There were plans to include actual online chat functionality and it is mostly working in a development build however I don’t want to have to moderate or maintain such a thing so I have no plans to implement it further.</p> <p>Play it on itch.io.</p> <iframe src="https://itch.io/embed/1391270?linkback=true&amp;border_width=0&amp;bg_color=222222&amp;fg_color=eeeeee&amp;border_color=363636" width="550" height="165" frameborder="0"><a href="https://haid.itch.io/dossip" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOSSIP.net by HAID</a></iframe> <iframe src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FKT_Rjvkevs?vq=hd1080&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0&amp;color=white&amp;controls=0&amp;disablekb=1" width="568" height="315" title="Indiegame Showcase: DOSSIP net - See the last minutes of a dying online game with very old graphics" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </body></html>
