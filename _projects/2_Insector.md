A 2.5D adventure game made for [2021s Github Game-off Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2021/entries "Woah here it is! "). The design was spearheaded by my friend known only as bean.
Featuring a lot of bad insect related puns and humour.

Footage from the PC and mobile development build exists but i havn't moved it over yet. :(
