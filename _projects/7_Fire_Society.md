I have some more things to say about this but alas this page is *unfinished.*

To decide on a new leader, the cultists settle it with a game of tag.
There's just one catch... losing means a fiery death. Made in two weeks
for[ Black and White jam](https://itch.io/jam/bw-jam "Link to black and white gamejam Itch.io page")
Fire Society is a third person multiplayer action game. The objective
is to be the last cultist standing, while setting all your friends
alight.

FInd the game here!
