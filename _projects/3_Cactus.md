I have some more things to say about this but alas this page is *unfinished.*

Cactus is a prototype built by me and my [friend](https://epicgameguy.itch.io/ "Link to his itch.io,Cool dude, great mentor. Great programmer!").
A work in progress multiplayer game that we have been working on for what seems like forever now.

I've made mostly cosmetic contributions. Over the years he has developed it into a pretty great third person stealth shooter, but it is more than that. A lot of the game is built from modular components and plugins.

This menas that we can piece out elements and use them to develop other projects quickly, provided they are made in Unreal or written in C++.
