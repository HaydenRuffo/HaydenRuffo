**"The '90s called, and they want their metaverse back!"**

Originally made in roughly a month for the [Dying MMO Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/death-of-an-mmo-game-jam).
An indulgent of my nostalgia for [early internet](https://theoldnet.com/ "The Old Internet Browser"). Dossip was made in Unreal 4.27, and a large effort was made to reduce the graphics of the engine as much as possible so it appears to play on 90s DOS based PCs (hence the name). I'm very proud of its successes for such a small game.

Some fun facts, The usernames were created by mashing together two databases. One that consisted of random online usernames scraped from various websites and another of just weird/funny words grabbed from [listicals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listicle "Wikipedia page for Listicles, weird word. ").

The large amount of chat text was crowdsourced by myself and my friends, the goal was to try and be bizzare.

A [friend ](https://epicgameguy.itch.io/)and my twin [brother ](https://www.instagram.com/ombelra/ "My twin instagram.")both contributed sprites to the project. The character meshes and textures are from [opengameart.org](https://opengameart.org/ "A great place for open game art.") and some shader features like the affine mapping that you see on the characters were created by [DaveFace](https://github.com/DaveFace/UnrealRetroShaders "Retro PS1 Post Processing effects.").

There were plans to include actual online chat functionality and it is mostly working in a development build however I don't want to have to moderate or maintain such a thing so I have no plans to implement it further.

FInd the game here!
