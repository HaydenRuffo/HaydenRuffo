I have some more things to say about this but alas this page is *unfinished.
Rocket Kick Love Groove is some music i've made, its also a [website](https://jetset.ju.mp/ "Link to https://jetset.ju.mp/ a promotional website for the EP "), also a [game](https://haid.itch.io/rklg "Link to the itch.io page for the game????")  and also a real CD.
Released October 1, 2021 its heavily inspired by the works of the CEO of funky fresh beats himself, Hideki Naganuma. A prominent videogame composer most famous for his in-house work for SEGA games between 1998-2008, oh and and his [twitter](https://twitter.com/Hideki_Naganuma "Hidekis wild twitter").

I grew up listening to Hideki's funky bigbeat music blend for [Jet Set Radio](Jet Set Radio Future "A great youtube documentary on the games") series particularly in Jet Set Radio Future.

I wrote this album trying to capture a similiar audio and visual style as a homage.
