My artistic journey all began with a fascination for electronic music. In 2011 I began learning how to produce my own music. Exploring styles and genres, I enjoy expanding my unique musical palette.

Curiosity drives my discovery. Embracing the freedom to experiment with different techniques and styles, self-teaching transformed my weaknesses into strengths and learning became an integral part of my creative process.

I later ventured into the realm of 3D, digital art and programming, a world of endless possibilities opened up. I found the challenge of creating my own interactive experiences a culmination of my skills and interests.
Today I continue to grow. I embrace the future of art and tech knowing that my own future is ever-evolving too.
