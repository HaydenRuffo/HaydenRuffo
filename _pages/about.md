My artistic journey has been shaped by exploring diverse mediums. It all began with a fascination for techno music during my early years, which led me to learn to produce music and explore various genres, creating a unique musical palette.

As a self-taught musician, curiosity has driven my discovery. Embracing the freedom to experiment with different techniques and styles, self-teaching transformed my weaknesses into strengths and learning became an integral part of my creative process.

Video games have been a lifelong passion, inspiring me to create my own interactive experiences. As I ventured into the realm of 3D, digital art and programming, a world of endless possibilities opened up.
As I continue to grow as an artist, I embrace the endless possibilities that expression and discovery offer, knowing that my artistic odyssey is ever-evolving and ever-full of potential.
