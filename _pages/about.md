Welcome to my website where you'll find ramblings about the projects I'm working on, along with an overview of my professional history.

I intend to write blog posts in the future about things that may be helpfull to others, but for now this website is all.......

## **About me!**

Born in Australia, I worked at my families Italian restaurant for most of my career but even then I never stopped pursuing digital artistry. Fascinated with techno, In high school I started learning how to produce my own music. I taught myself about music theory and audio production, later expanding beyond music and into 3D art and game development.

I love the challenge of creating interactive experiences and making videogames combines all my digital skills and interests.
Today I'm embracing my future and doing what I love.
