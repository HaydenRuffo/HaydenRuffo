My artistic journey has been shaped by digital media. It all began with a fascination for techno music during my early years, which then led me to learn to produce my own music and explore styles and genres. I enjoy designing my unique musical palette.

As a self-taught musician, curiosity drives my discovery. Embracing the freedom to experiment with different techniques and styles, self-teaching transformed my weaknesses into strengths and learning became an integral part of my creative process.

As I ventured into the realm of 3D, digital art and programming, a world of endless possibilities opened up. I found the challenge of creating my own interactive experiences and videogames a culmination of my skills and intrests.
Today I continue to grow. I embrace the future of art and tech knowing that my own future is ever-evolving too.
