Welcome to my website where you'll find ramblings about the projects I've worked on, along with a comprehensive overview of my professional background.

Right now I'm moving things over from my previous website, so things may read a little *unfinished.
I intend to write blog posts in the future about things that may be helpfull to others, but for now this website is all.......

## **About me!**

It began with my fascination for electronic music. Back in 2010, I started learning how to produce my own music. Thanks to the internet, I taught myself  about music theory and audio production. Curiosity drove my discovery, and I soon started exploring different techniques and styles, expanding beyond just music.

One day, a good friend gave me some really great advice: "You are never competing with others, you are only competing with yourself."

Those words freed me from my insecurities and transformed my weaknesses into strengths. Learning became an integral part of my creative process. And that's when I ventured into the realm of 3D, digital art, and programming. I loved the challenge of creating my own interactive experiences and making videogames combined all my skills and interests.

While I worked at a restaurant for most of my working life, I never stopped pursuing my digital artistry in my free time. Today I'm embracing my future and doing what I love.
