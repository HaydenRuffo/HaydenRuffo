Reflecting on my artistic journey, I find myself tracing my inspirations through a myriad of mediums, with each playing a pivotal role in shaping my artistic expression. It all began with an enchanting fascination for techno at a very tender age, which gradually led me to explore the possibility of producing my own music and unleashing my creative spirit. Soon after, I delved into the rhythms of hip-hop, funk, and sampling, later fusing genres and mixing many colors into my own musical palette.

As a self-taught musician, my journey has been a process of discovery and relentless curiosity. Embracing the freedom to explore different techniques and styles, self-teaching transformed my weaknesses into strengths, becoming an inseparable part of my creative process and shaping the authenticity and individuality of my art. Today, I wear the badge of a mostly self-taught artist with immense pride, recognizing that my path is my own while acknowledging the benefits of learning from others.

My passion for video games began at the age of 6, and much like my love for music, I always wanted to learn how to create my own games. In my late teens, I embarked on my journey into the interactive medium. My foray into digital art and graphic design was fueled by my immersion in video games at a young age. Exploring digital art unlocked a new realm of creativity for me, and I found joy in experimenting with digital tools and manipulating visuals to create striking artworks.

Games like "The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind" left a profound impression on me with its rich fantasy setting, featuring intricate details of damp marshes, alien-like fauna, and flora. The bonemold Hlaalu guard armor and helmet became imprinted in my art, blending with illustrations from Emily Rodda's "Deltora Quest." Similarly, "Halo" had a profound impact on my young artistic mind, with its highly saturated colors, iridescent metal armor designs, and captivating science fiction military setting that continues to inspire my artwork. Additionally, "Jet Set Radio: Future" introduced me to vibrant cel-shaded art, which I enthusiastically incorporated into my earliest drawings, and the music, particularly songs by Hideki Naganuma, continues to influence my artistic expression.

In conclusion, my self-taught approach to both music and art has shaped me into a multifaceted artist. The inspirations I found in video games, the allure of fantasy realms, and the exploration of digital art have all played a role in defining my unique artistic expression. Each step of this journey has been a labor of love, driven by a relentless curiosity to create and an unwavering commitment to authenticity. As I continue to grow as an artist, I embrace the endless possibilities that self-expression and self-discovery offer, knowing that my artistic odyssey is ever-evolving and full of potential.
